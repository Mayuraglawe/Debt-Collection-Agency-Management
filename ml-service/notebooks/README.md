# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and model prototyping.

## Guidelines

- Use descriptive names with dates: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.ipynb`
- Document your findings and insights
- Clean up notebooks before committing
- Move production-ready code to `app/` modules
